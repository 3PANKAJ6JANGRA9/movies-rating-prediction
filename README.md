# Movie Rating Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## Description
This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using Multiple Linear Regression.
The model learns the relationship between movie attributes and their ratings and
predicts the expected rating for a given movie.

## Dataset Features
Independent variables:
- Budget
- Duration
- Votes
- Year
- Genre Score

Dependent variable:
- Rating

## Methodology
1. Movie data is loaded and preprocessed.
2. Features are standardized.
3. Multiple Linear Regression model is trained.
4. Movie ratings are predicted based on input attributes.
5. Model performance is evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R² score.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Future Scope
- Improve prediction accuracy with more data
- Add advanced features like actor and director popularity
- Extend to a recommendation system
